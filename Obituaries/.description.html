<b>Guide to LMHS Resources</b>
<br>
<p>The library holds a large collection of obituary clippings and death records from local newspapers and other sources. Obituary clippings come chiefly from the Lancaster Intelligencer Journal and are complete from 1970 to the present. Earlier records are much less complete but extend into the late 1700s. An index to these various records by surname is available by clicking on the files to the right, which provide the name of the deceased; year, month, and day of death; age; and source. Some entries include date of newspaper.</p>
<br>
<p><b>Following is a guide to the sources referenced in the indexes:</b></p>
<br>
<p><b>AKS OBIT BK:</b> Scrapbooks of obituaries clipped by genealogist Amos K. Stauffer, from 1884-1961. The scrapbooks contain obituaries of personal interest and are not comprehensive for a given time period or geographic area.</p>
<br>
<p><b>EM BOOK:</b> Scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and other items collected by Etta Musser (1917-2008), from ca. 1932-2008. Currently this collection is indexed but not scanned. Copies may made from the scrapbooks in the Etta Musser Papers or requested from LMHS staff.</p>
<br>
<p><b>HANNES EBY BUR REC:</b> Record of burials (not obituaries) kept by John (Hannes) Eby from 1793-1845, chiefly of his friends, associates, and relatives in northern Lancaster County.</p>
<br>
<p><b>IDL DIARY:</b> Diaries of Ira D. Landis, the first director of the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society. An avid historian and genealogist, Ira clipped obituaries of personal interest from the local papers and pasted them in his diaries. The clippings are not comprehensive for a given time period or geographic area.</p>
<br>
<p><b>INTELLIGENCER JOURNAL:</b> Obituaries from the Lancaster newspaper saved as pdf files from Jan. 2013 to the present. Note: The indexing project is ongoing so the more recent obituaries may be incomplete in the index. These obituaries are not currently available on the LMHS website.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JB LEDGER (TRANS):</b> Transcription and translation of the ledger kept by coffin-maker Johannes Bachman of Strasburg, Pa., in which he recorded the names of persons for whom he built coffins from 1771-1810. This is a record of deaths rather than a collection of obituaries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>JNB BOOK:</b> Records of funeral sermons preached by Mennonite Bishop Jacob N. Brubacher from his church record books, 1880-1913. This is not a collection of obituaries.</p>
<br>
<p><b>LANC NEWSPAPERS:</b> Obituaries from the Lancaster newspapers saved as hard copy (on original newsprint) from March 2005 through May 2008, or as pdf files from June 2008 through 2012 (not currently available on the LMHS website).</p>
<br>
<p><b>MISC SCRAPBOOK:</b> Scrapbooks of newspaper clippings and other items, whose compilers are unknown. Currently this collection is indexed but not scanned. Copies may made from the scrapbooks requested from LMHS staff.</p>
<br>
<p><b>SCRAPBOOK:</b> For many years volunteers at the Lancaster Mennonite Historical Society systematically clipped obituaries from the Lancaster newspapers and pasted them in scrapbooks by date. These range from 1970 through February 2005. The obituaries prior to 1970 are very selective. The earliest scrapbooks contain a handful of death notices (not true obituaries) from the Lititz Record Express from the early 1900s. Obituaries after Feb. 2005 are available but only at the Society or by request (research@lmhs.org). To view a scrapbook (see column to the right), click first on the year of interest to you, then navigate to the correct scrapbook page. The pages are numbered with the following format: [YYYY-PPPx], where Y=year, P=page #, and x=additional scans of the same page. Some pages have been scanned more than once because of clippings that are folded over, obscuring other clippings.</p>
<br>
<p><b>WASH HSE REG:</b> List of deaths (not obituaries) copied from the "Washington House Registers," Strasburg, Pa., from Feb. 1875-Aug. 1880.</p>
