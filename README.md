This project is a fork of Cute File Browser (found at
http://tutorialzine.com/2014/09/cute-file-browser-jquery-ajax-php/).
Unfortunately, no license is included with the code, but the author encourages
people to download it, modify it, and try it out. It is currently modified to
browse a large index of obituaries. The primary modification that I have made is
the addition of a description mechanism, where a file called '.description.html'
can be added to any given directory to print an HTML description of its
contents.
